# Handwriting OCR

A collection of Python scripts for converting handwritten journal entries to text using Apple's built-in OCR.

Most of this code was generated by ChatGPT and modified to work with my file storage conventions.

In my experience, Apple's Vision framework is pretty good at correctly converting my handwriting. However, it consistently fails to recognise certain words (for example "focus" or many other words beginning with the letter "f"). For that reason I also wrote some scripts to find common misspellings and grammar errors.
